# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I think python is very intresting. It reminds me of Java quite a bit but yet very different still.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Some similarities that I have found between python and java (the only other programming language I have used) is using the print function to printe stuff and the brackets for lists. Although similar they are slightly different in the way we use and define these in able for the code to work. Especially in Java in CSA almost every line depending on what we are coding ending with ";" but in python we don't.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
Some things I learned in this assignment is that I need to keep practicing because I am still getting back to coding since I didn't code last year. I learned how to print stuff in python and if, elif, else statements and how to use them in python.
